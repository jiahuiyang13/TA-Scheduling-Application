**Summary:**

Worked on a team developing a web application in Python to streamline the TA scheduling process for the computer science department. The application allows supervisors/administrators (department chair), instructors, and TAs to manage course and TA assignments, as well as contact information. The application follows the Agile Scrum methodology to ensure efficient development and adaptation to changing requirements.

**Key Achievements:**

Implemented user roles and permissions for supervisors/administrators, instructors, and TAs to manage course assignments, TA assignments, and contact information.

Developed features for creating, editing, and deleting courses and user accounts, as well as assigning instructors and TAs to courses and lab sections.

Integrated UWM email notifications for supervisors/administrators and instructors to communicate with TAs.

Ensured privacy of personal contact information while allowing supervisors/administrators access for administrative purposes.

Utilized Agile Scrum methodology to collaborate with team members, prioritize tasks, and deliver incremental updates to the application.

**Challenges Overcome:**

Balancing the need for privacy of personal contact information with the requirements of supervisors/administrators to access this information for administrative purposes.

Ensuring that the application is user-friendly and intuitive for all user roles, considering the varying levels of technical expertise among users.

Adapting to changing requirements and feedback from stakeholders while maintaining the project timeline and deliverables.

**Next Steps:**

Conduct user testing and gather feedback to identify areas for improvement and additional features.

Implement enhancements based on feedback, such as improving user interface and adding features for more efficient communication and scheduling.

Continuously monitor and maintain the application to ensure reliability and scalability as the department's needs evolve.
